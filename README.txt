Game Parameters

The game area is a 10x10 grid depicting the player’s house.
The player (p) always starts in the top left corner and the zombie (z) on coordinates (5,5).
The player is confined to the game area by ‘if statements’ resetting the player’s position if they try to go outside of the grid. 
To move, use the keys w, s, a, and d to move up, down, left, or right.
You must press Enter after each selection.

Added Features

The narrator explains the zombie plague, your current predicament, and how to play the game.
There is gear randomly placed around the play area – armor ($), boots (&), weapon (+), and key (%). 
You cannot exit (#) until all the gear has been collected.
Text pops up throughout the game as you collect pieces of gear.
Each time you collect a piece of gear, another zombie enters the play area.
If you are caught by a zombie, the game is redrawn with the player no longer appearing, having been eaten by the zombie.
If you are able to collect all your gear and escape the house, the game is redrawn to a 20x20 grid, depicting the outside world. 
The narrator congratulates the player for getting out, but they also warn the player that they are in a much bigger mess.
The player is surrounded by even more zombies.
This is the end of the game, but it allows for further levels to be added.
